;0x13A5DA82=Liberty City Mayor, Julio Ochoa, has caved to pressure and reopened the bridges separating Algonquin from the eastern boroughs. In a cautious move, the Hickey Bridge and Booth Tunnel have remained closed because N.O.O.S.E officials are convinced of specific but unnamed threats to the West River crossings. Some city officials have countered that not even a terrorist would want to live in Alderney.

All we know is our pensions are probably screwed while some shitdick is riding to his 10-million-dollar house upstate in an Italian sports car.

;0x8497FDE1=In what will have a massive affect on the American economy, the BAWSAQ closed up 12 points.
