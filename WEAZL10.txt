;0xC5559754=But leftist loons have opened the borders to evil people hell bent on the destruction of our freedom. Everyday we allow foreign nationals to enter this country. They steal American jobs, they seduce American women, soon enough they will bomb American subways. The only answer is to take these leftwing loons, obsessed with political correctness, out of office. I'm talking about people like Jacquise Benson, Doris Fung, and Mary Mayfly - liberals in City Hall who care more about the freedom of terrorists than the freedom of American citizens.

;0xF20C70C1=The terror threat level in Liberty City has stayed at Magenta 5 for the last year. Liberty City is the jewel in the crown of the United States of America. It is a country that is indisputably the only world power and should fear no one. Why is it that citizens of this great country are scared of the violent actions of a marginalized group? People in Algonquin, Broker, Bohan, Dukes and Alderney are justifiably scared of a horrific act of terrorism because this country has not put the correct measures in place to protect itself. Americans have a constitutional right to be protected from foreigners.

;0xFC0944E5=Just imagine - it's 98 degrees outside and you have to walk to work. No air-conditioned comfortable SUV to sit in traffic in. No listening to your favorite WKTT radio shows in the morning commute. Or worse yet, sitting on a smelly train with no-manners immigrants shoving curry in their faces and clipping their toenails while they mutter "death to America." This is the future the liberals have planned if new global warming legislation is passed. While the rest of the first world may have bought science's lies, we haven't. Call your congressman and tell him (or if you are really unfortunate, her) to stop listening to scientists with an agenda. Let's keep America moving forward.
