;0x2F8DDDE3=Police have confirmed reports that a body they recovered was identified as Aiden O'Mally - the convict and possible one-time terrorist who was sprung from a prison van recently in a violent attack. At the time, it was presumed that O'Malley had friends in criminally high places. Now it seems he was freed so he could be silenced, or punished for past crimes. Police have no leads on what might have been behind the need to silence or kill Mr. O'Malley, 48. O'Malley was born and raised in Dukes but spent much of his adult life in Ireland and Britain, where he was thought to have links with several paramilitary and terrorist groups. Some experts claim that, since the ending of the Troubles, several former activists have returned to Liberty City and are engaged in the settling of old scores, while also getting involved in new forms of crime including drug dealing.

;0x6FB2E799=He's not just a dork - he's also in serious medical trouble. That's right. The family member you worry about who is lost in the cyber hell of video games is not just a sociopath planning to kill you and everyone else you love, he is also threatening the future of the entire human race - by making himself impotent. Yes - video games - already responsible for most murders and 40% of all deaths in America, are also causing men to become impotent. Scientists paid for by a famous TV company said so yesterday and it seems probable. We will stay with this story, until the lack of evidence makes it impossible to do so while still retaining the tiny shred of journalistic dignity we have left.
