;0x39935606=Anyway, I jumped ship and I'm around. I'm just down in Florida, but I'm back soon. Hopefully bump into you. I might get job selling fake handbags in Suffolk. There's a lot of money to be made there. It's crazy!

;0x67D93291=How you doing? Did you decide to stay in Liberty City? How's your cousin? I stayed. I heard everyone did. Did you hear about poor Captain. Poor man. He turned up dead and drunk in the river. And everyone else jumped ship? I wonder what those Chinese guys did with that heroin they were supposedly smuggling?
