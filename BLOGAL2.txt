;0x093F06C3=That's where private education and an apartment in Monaco gets you! Turns out this guy was from Eastern Europe! An immigrant! His name was something like Nino or Nico or Nonso. He could hardly speak English, had a face like a construction worker and his dress sense was simply GHASTLY! I bet he hasn't got a peseta, or whatever money they've got where he's from, to his name. I just hope that nobody on the scene saw me with him. And imagine introducing him to Daddy?! He's already threatened to cut off my credit cards. Could not bear to even think of that. All in all, it was the most painful date of my life. And when you've woken up on a beach with a professional wrestler in every orifice, that's saying something.

;0x0B0C3415=I was so glad that I had my hand sanitizer with me. I shudder to think how many criminals have had their fingers in those sweaty holes. My hands haven't smelt so bad since my fateful night in the restroom of the Libertonian Museum with that state senator. You live and learn. Never give a 65-year-old man a prostate massage when he has food poisoning. I sat next to his wife at the Didier Sachs show in San Fierro last month. It's a powerful feeling to know that you an have any man you want. Toodle pip. Alex xxxxxx

;0x10B7B375=Today might just have been the worst day of my life. Worse than the time they made me stand in line at Maisonette 9. Worse than the time LC24 photographed me without high heels. Worse than the time my therapist got me pregnant. Worse than the time that so-called investment banker flew me to Vice City in cattle class. Niko took me to this awful fast food restaurant in some ghastly ghetto out in the sticks. I'm lucky to still be alive. My whole outfit is going straight in the trash. The stench of the underclass is something that you can never wash off. As if things couldn't get any worse, two ugly people were kissing at one of the tables.

;0x176520A5=Every time I purge eggs benedict, I start thinking about sex. Don't ask me why. It's the same with asparagus. Maybe it's something to do with that night I don't remember with the chef at Gozushi. Anyway, Niko and I are SO totally taking it to the next level sexually. He's such a snarling ball of testosterone!

;0x179554F7=Hello darlings! How goes it with you? How goes it with me, more importantly?!!!! That's why you're reading this thing, isn't it? To live your own lives vicariously through mine? Well, big date with the Mysterious European to report! Maybe he's not just an uncultured brute with a sexy accent and a bulging package after all. We went for drinks to a swanky bar in Algonquin and I got a little tipsy, I have to admit!

;0x1B22E673=Why do I keep dating these losers on craplist? My psychiatrist tells me it's because I'm a bipolar nymphomaniac who craves the approval of men in order to mask my deep-seated insecurity and self-loathing. He also tells me to keep my boots on when he's taking me from behind so I don't pay him much attention. Niko took me on a date to play pool today and I nearly died. I gave him a chance to impress me and he blew it. Big time. I haven't been that far out of my comfort zone since my foray into goatse last year. Love ya, girls xxxxx

;0x207A5EF1=Where is that delivery guy with Valentino's mineral water? Poor little doggy. He must be new. As soon as he sees my tight ass in a pair of booty shorts, he'll never be late again. This morning I got vodka delivered to my door in two minutes flat. Maybe I'll let him feel my new implants tomorrow? He's quite cute for a Mexican. Poor Valentino. There's no way I'm giving him any of that ghetto water out the tap. Speaking of ghettos, my Mysterious European showed me his true colors today. It was his big chance to impress me and where did we go? Ten-pin bowling!

;0x2258BB22=My body is so ridiculously toned right now, I can't even begin to tell you. If you didn't know I was 29, you would honestly think it was a high-school cheerleader riding some perverted older guy. I started having flashbacks to my Sweet 16 at one point. I wonder what Coach Jenkins is doing now??? Watching Niko bullfroging me on top of the washing machine got me thinking - could this swarthy foreigner be my knight in shining armor? Might it take a wild animal to tame this party girl?

;0x266EDEE3=UGGH!!! They should ban it or keep them in a special compound or something. Don't get me wrong; I'm more than happy to do my part for the poor people. I'll be the first through the door at a $1,000-a-head charity fundraiser in a little black dress and some strappy sandals. But I don't need to experience their base existence first-hand. I feel like I need to be disinfected or something. I really can't see things working out with this Niko guy. Maybe this kind of approach works for girls in Russia or wherever he's from but this is Alex Chilton, not some peasant girl who works down a mine. I'm going to drink some Pinot, take some painkillers and pray for a full blackout. Toodles xxxxx

;0x2DE50BF7=Thought of the day. Is it worth marrying a man you hate if he has a penthouse apartment? I think so. Let's break it down. I spend an average of 17 hours a day awake (depending on levels of cocaine use) and it takes me about 10 minutes to give the type of slobbering, pornstar blowjob that men equate with true love. That is less than 1% of my day. Not bad for a girl who skipped math class to give herself a Brazilian wax with a ruler and a cigarette lighter!

;0x31378827=Probably because I haven't eaten for 5 days but regular meals won't get you into a size zero dress, chicas! My eyes look smoking when I'm drunk, everybody tells me that. I tried to edge closer to him to pull off my trademark crotch brush at one point but he backed away. I don't think he's used to a liberated woman in killer heels! Toodles for now xxxxxxxx

;0x33065A51=I just might give up on Craplist. Nobody looks anything like their photos and most of the men I meet are either incontinent senior citizens or perverts. I mean, I'm up for as much exploration of my sexuality as the next girl but even I draw the line at getting fisted by a chimpanzee while its owner watches dressed as a spaceman. What am I doing messing around with these losers? I should stick to hanging out at Maisonette 9 with Heidi and Paige and whispering in men's ears that I'm not wearing any panties. At least the guys there know how to treat a girl - champagne followed by hateful sex. This neanderthal I met tonight wouldn't know his grand cru from his grand cul. A little French joke for you there, girlies!

;0x39C87714=So what if I'm having sex with a stranger I met online? Niko certainly isn't complaining. My mother once said that the path to true love is a rocky one, paved with shit and backstreet abortions. Maybe there's some truth in that. Maybe it makes no sense. She was a violent drunk who beat me with a rubber hose for not being pretty enough. Sometimes you have to take one for the team. Sometimes you have to take one from the team. To find Mr. Right, you have to sleep with a lot of Mr. Wrongs. Stay fabulous. Nitey night xxxx

;0x49917184=Buckle up and hold on tight, girls, because the rollercoaster that is Alex Chilton's love life is plunging towards rock bottom. In a million years, you would never guess where my Mysterious European took me today. Cocktails on the roof of the Majestic? Shopping at Yogarishma? Facials at Le Chien? I wish. No, Mr. Romantic decided that he would woo me with a game of darts in an Irish Bar! DARTS! It was like everything I'd worked for all my life - the shoes, the killer body, the party invitations - vanished in an instant, stained forever with the filth of the underclass.

;0x596EC8D6=But maybe that's it. Maybe I am TOO perfect. Maybe I am TOO fashionable. Maybe I scare men away with my supermodel looks and fierce intellect. It must be hard for the average man to handle a party girl at the top of her social game. Not to mention my blog. But that's the whole point: I'm not looking for an average man. A girl like me, a perfect 10 with no gag reflex who can work any room on the face of the planet, deserves to be on the arm of a man with style, taste and means. And I am more than happy to forego the style and taste. Is it too much to ask for an Algonquin loft, a beach home, ski chalet, European pied-a-terre and a yacht in the Caribbean?

;0x5B891573=I told Heidi about it and she is refusing to speak to me. What is it about this uncivilized brute that keeps drawing me in? Why do I always go for the wrong guys? I think that it is so important to end the day with a question and start the day with an answer... or a rail and a dirty martini.

;0x5E68CC91=OMG!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe I forgot to tell you about my latest sexploits with Niko! The past couple of days have been such a blur! You're not going to believe this but I just had to steam-clean my whole apartment... AGAIN!!! The kitchen looked like a bomb had hit it and my chaise longue was covered in peanut butter! At least, I hope it was peanut butter.

;0x68D8E7AA=Niko took me out to a restaurant. And I use 'restaurant' in the loosest sense of the word. You're not going to believe this but it was OUTSIDE ALGONQUIN! In one of those hideous boroughs where all the hired help live. Me! Alex Chilton! The girl voted 8th best-dressed socialite in a 2006 poll of Middle Park East trustfunders! I could have died! This place was horrendously tacky and beneath me. I don't think they've ever seen designer clothing in there before. I feel completely used and humiliated and not in a good way. I mean, I am the ultimate catch for a man. Have you seen my tits and ass? Beautiful, intelligent, artistic, uninhibited... there aren't enough adjectives in the dictionary to describe Alex Chilton.

;0x6C9768EE=Those Europeans are so kinky! Heidi told me that there is a whole village in Spain of men married to wild boars. I think he was spanking me with a frying pan at one point and the French baguette I bought on the way back from capoeira is pretty much ruined. Not that I was ever going to eat it. My vagina tightening workshop is definitely paying dividends, btw. It's like a weightlifter's fist down there! Toodles! xxx

;0x6CEA9BFC=We made love on the antique Persian rug in the hall of my apartment. Rough, animalistic sex... just the way I like it. The first one was a little quick but you can't blame the guy. I'm a perfect 10 with pelvic muscles like a nutcracker. I'm heading out right now to meet Heidi and Paige so that we can discuss his girth over cosmopolitans. It's so amazing being a beautiful, intelligent, sexually-aggressive woman with a Middle Park East apartment, stunning clothes and incredible friends. SIGH. Toodles xxxx

;0x791CB460=Hola chicas! Stop what you're doing and read about my life! Guess what?! I've finally got my Slavic wings! One well-hung immigrant and Alex Chilton has conquered the Balkan Peninsula! Niko and I took our relationship to the next level today. And not before time! We went back to my apartment and I surprised him by changing into my schoolgirl outfit. Bringing out the big guns! Ratatattat!!! He told me that he wanted to be inside me and I swooned. Sometimes men know just the right thing to say.

;0x87C23AED=Burning question of the day (and I mean that literally) - clit ring or no clit ring? My mysterious European can't get enough of it but that's no surprise considering he comes from a country where the women have sideburns and no teeth. But maybe that's what guys like? God, so many questions the meds do that to me sometimes. One minute I'm floating on a fluffy cloud of numb ambivalence, the next I'm talking to my reflection in a shop window.

;0x94088E9B=My Mysterious European caught me by surprise today with a date to one of my favorite Algonquin restaurants. For a man whose idea of high fashion is matching socks, this was a pleasant surprise and I'm starting to think that romance is in the air for this high society girl! I really wanted to suggest some cream pie for dessert but I'm not sure that he would have picked up on the duble entondrah (that's French, btw :-o). Ah, Paris in the spring... I'm really in uncharted territory here.

I must have been crazy to think that I could mould that Russian philistine into some kind of sophisticate?!!! He probably doesn't even play tennis. Can you believe that he had the nerve, the barefaced nerve, to take ME to some awful dive bar? I am in shock right now. I've never seen a group of people more in need of cosmetic surgery in my life.

;0xA0EA1394=The way I see it, being a liberated woman is about taking back the power. Giggle like a school girl over dinner and then beat his balls with a rolling pin when you get home. And this has nothing to do with my father, whatever my therapist says. Take Niko, for example, my Mysterious European. A man's man, if ever I saw one. Well, believe me, even tough guys cry when you burn their nipples with a cigarette lighter. He was shaking like a shitting dog by the time he left my place. A thousand-dollar heel up the ass soon separates the men from the boys. Ciao. Alex xxxxx I actually think that my breasts are getting perkier, btw!!!

;0xA168E816=Que horror! Somebody hose me down! I'm covered in the germs of the common man. Niko dragged me to the most disgusting bar you have ever seen today. The kind of place where inbred reprobates come to fight and fornicate in between acts of crime. I've seen it on TV. It was terrifying - they all looked at me as if they'd never seen a smoking-hot Algonquin socialite before. There'll be a few men masturbating tonight, I can tell you. If that's his idea of a date, he can go back to Madrid or Moscow or wherever he's from.

Maybe I should have told him about the video camera but he'd only have gone all European and awkward on me. I'll post it on Electric Tit as soon as I find the right soundtrack. Wow, talk about reaching my sexual peak! The backwards roll into handstand with him still inside me was nothing short of spectacular!
0xA4CF3FED=Fuck me I'm a goddess. You have GOT to watch this tape I made of Niko and me getting down and dirty in my apartment! Maybe I should have told him about the video camera but he'd only have gone all European and awkward on me. I'll post it on Electric Tit as soon as I find the right soundtrack. Wow, talk about reaching my sexual peak! The backwards roll into handstand with him still inside me was nothing short of spectacular!

;0xA8BBDAAC=It was the perfect date. Expensive drinks surrounded by beautiful people. That's what life is all about. My life, anyway! I'd been doing blow all day so the last thing I wanted was food or conversation.

;0xA9074588=There might be more to my Mysterious European than just bad English and skin like leather. He took me out to eat at a borderline-acceptable restaurant in Algonquin today and I didn't even choose it! He's a little rough around the edges - certainly not my usual type! - but he knows how to treat a lady and he is starting to open up to me, I think. I wanted to open myself up to him right there on the table after that meal, I can tell you! I still have no idea what he does or where he lives but that's part of the excitement. The danger turns me on. There's something about those eyes. I'm thinking about how well-hung he is.

;0xB2D5B76B=I've spent the last 6 hours staring at a blank TV screen and now I feel like musing whimsically about what it means to be a modern woman. How do we carve out a sexual identity for ourselves in the 21st century? And I'm not talking about cutting myself after masturbation. That's all in the past and I'm much happier now.

;0xBB467FC1=Niko earned himself a lot of brownie points today! I might even dress up like a brownie for him, if he plays his cards right. My stomach is so ripped right now, I really could pass for a girl half my age. He took me to this cool spot for cocktails which was just what the doctor ordered. Actually, the doctor ordered me to start eating before I have a heart attack but what does he know? I didn't hear him complaining when he was pile-driving me over the defibrillator.

;0xBD357DEC=Liberated Women! I'm starting to wonder how liberated some of you really are. I just got an email calling me a "spoilt attention-starved slut" who "uses the approval of men to validate her meaningless existence". Er, whatever, bitch!!!! You sound like my therapist. This is the 21st century. We are sassy, independent women. It's not about burning your bra any more. It's about removing it with no hands at the dinner table while flicking a martini olive with the tip of your tongue.

;0xC0AE4C4B=Uggh! I feel physically sick and not just from the tranks I crushed up and rubbed into my gums earlier. If he looks like an uncivilized barbarian, acts like an uncivilized barbarian and talks like an uncivilized barbarian, then he probably is an uncivilized barbarian. I must be out of my mind. What did I expect from an immigrant I met online? I've been humiliated in the worst way possible by a man who almost certainly has never done brunch in his life. Can you believe that he took me bowling? Can you get any more white trash than that?

;0xC2DF7938=Underlying his gruff, awkward manner is the kind of quiet self-assurance that only comes with a member of a certain size. He doesn't seem to be intimidated by my beauty and intellect. Overawed by it, of course, but not intimidated. I can spot small penis syndrome a mile away. I have a pretty good radar for these things... in fact, I've never met anyone more insightful than me. That's why I blog. To unveil the truths about love and life that lie hidden to all but the most perceptive. Sometimes the truth hurts but so does a champagne bottle up the ass in a penthouse suite. Nobody said that being an Algonquin socialite was easy.

;0xCCDF54E3=I was talking to Paige about Niko and she told me that people in eastern Europe just shit on the side of the road when the need strikes them. Que horror! My new meds are great, btw. I can get that doctor to sign over half of Holland Hospital Center if I strip nice and slowly. I don't know what it is about Niko but I feel all warm and gooey inside. Could it be love? Or is it just the first rumblings of cocaine diarrhea?

;0xD22C375B=If the poor are so poor, why are they all so fat? Would it kill them to exfoliate once in a while? It was the most demeaning thing that has ever happened to me. I'm used to blowing married men on private jets not fraternizing with the hired help in a disease-infested shithole. I've probably got AIDS.

;0xD262EFB4=I might as well start wearing polyester and giving birth every three weeks. This is the girl who once flew to Sicily for a cannoli. Which I threw up immediately. I was willing to give Niko some leeway, being a foreigner and all. They don't have the same dating etiquette in the second world. Paige told me that men in Scotland mount women in the streets like dogs. But this might have been the final straw for my Mysterious European. Love is fleeting; a bad reputation lasts a lifetime.

;0xD9B0D799=Stick a fork in me. I'm done. My credibility on the Algonquin party circuit has been trampled under the rough hooves of the common herd. I thought that it wasn't possible to sink any lower on a date than that advertising guy who ordered the house wine (I didn't swallow that night on principle) but my Mysterious European plummeted to new depths of barbarity today.

;0xDAACF07E=My Mysterious European took me out on a date to a Russian cabaret club in Broker today. Not the usual hangout for a drop-dead gorgeous Algonquin socialite but I'd been snorting painkillers all day and I have to admit that I quite enjoyed it. Maybe I should have gotten up there and done my trick with the ping pong ball! Those Europeans are so quaint and quirky with all their acts and games. When you don't have a TV or prescription meds, I suppose you'll do anything to get through the day.

;0xE1532ED3=Then I got home and ate a blueberry muffin at around 250 calories. I am so weak sometimes. Going on a 4-day water fast tomorrow. Maybe a couple of cocktails to take the edge off. Nico has never heard of a bloody mary... can you believe that?!!!! Watch this space.

;0xE4F2F82A=Oh the shame of it! My reputation is in tatters. If the press finds out that Alex Chilton was playing darts, I am finished in this town. You can't bounce back from something like that. Niko thought that it would be a fun thing for us to do together. Er, maybe on the Balkan Peninsular, sweetheart, but this is Algonquin. My idea of a fun date is ordering a $200-salad, not eating it, blacking out on wine and riding a married hedge fund manager in the back of a limo.

;0xE91DB8C4=I've always liked it a bit rough, I suppose, but never in public like this! If Paige and Heidi saw Niko, they would just DIE! I often think back to the gardener at my parents' place upstate and wince a little, in a good way. Those filthy finger nails and stubble like sandpaper. Mmmmmmm. Yummy. No wonder I failed my SATs! Then my bitch of a mother found out and tried to cancel all my store cards. I hate her. I wish she'd hurry up and die. If she didn't pay my bills, I'd never speak to the drug-addled cow again.

;0xE9E6F805=I can hardly bring myself to admit this but I played POOL. Alex Chilton! If I wasn't so zoned on coke and painkillers, I'm not sure that I would be able to handle the shame right now. Thank god for my art. What would I do without my blog? Writing is my outlet, a way of channeling my innermost thoughts and fears into something meaningful, something that will inspire liberated women of the world to be the best that they can be. Toodles for now. Alex xxxxx

;0xEB4842C5=His accent is so deep and erotic. As soon as he saw me, I could tell that he was undressing me with his eyes. Dark, brooding eyes. There's something so raw, so masculine about him. We talked for hours. Well, I did most of the talking. He is more of the strong silent type. Somehow I don't think he's a lawyer, though. Not sure that I am going to be able to introduce him to Heidi and Paige just yet!

;0xEE72CEC1=It's never going to be a substitute for getting sandwiched by two corporate lawyers in the back of a limousine but perhaps some blue collar loving was just what the doctor ordered? Well, actually, the doctor ordered me to stop doing coke before I have another heart attack but you know what I mean. Sometimes when you have steak every day, you just want a greasy burger. Do we spend too much time chasing the wrong men? Could Mr. Right be the plumber or construction worker? Or are they just like mopeds? Fun to ride until your friends find out? Toodle pip xxxx

;0xF95497F0=He plays his cards close to his chest but, if he wants to get his hands on mine again, he's going to have to raise his game big time. And I want to see a copy of his bank balance. I'm starting to think that he might not be an oligarch or oil tycoon after all. It's about time this mysterious European got a bit less mysterious. Ciao xxx

;0xFD19E668=Guess what! I went on another date with a guy from craplist today. And he's not a sex offender! As far as I can tell, anyway. This whole online thing is finally starting to work out for me. It's a much easier way to meet men than leaning over tables of drunken investment bankers with my breasts pushed together. I suppose that I have become a bit more picky since that guy mixed me a drink and I woke up on an operating table in Peru three days later. Doctors get me swooning every time. He's called Niko and he's from Russia or Europe or somewhere like that.
