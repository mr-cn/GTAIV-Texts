;0x2BAB1D53=Now, he's also come out as a homosexual, married with children. Well, it's scarcely surprising. He's a liberal. Wooly thinking is their watchword. Or watch words. This news organization can never be accused of wooly thinking (apart from our weird attitude to China, but let's ignore that), so we will continue to attack liberals like him, until we have driven them out of this country for good.

;0x38A0373D=Why do we think this? Mr. Dawkins admitted he took pity on Mr. Crane and gave him somewhere to stay. If this isn't an awful example of people expecting state handouts, I don't know what is. Quite frankly, I think we'd all prefer it if Mr. Crane was Mr. Dawkins' lover. It is an awful example to set. Pity is for the weak.

;0x5C64FEC6=Disgraced sinner, Bryce Dawkins, was hiding a terrible secret. He lived a double life. In public, he was a staunch hang 'em and flog 'em conservative, but in private, he was a filthy liberal. The fact is Mr. Dawkins was not as conservative as he made out. He even owned a passport. Most terrorists own passports, as do many drug dealers.
