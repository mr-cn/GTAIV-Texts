;0x1F74373F=The market has been chaotic recently. One day it's up, the next it's down. Now it's stabilized - it's started going steadily down. This makes it easier for people drawing graphs, if not for investors. It's been carnage on the market these past few days, but despite that, no one is dead. It's a metaphorical miracle, which is great for everyone apart from people who like watching snuff movies. But I digress - the economy is in free fall. People are out of jobs, and house prices are falling again. Worse, lots of rich people will see bonuses cut, but they are unlikely to have to forego that much.

;0x224A9A04=Some, however, are skeptical about their real significance. An anonymous source said, "The Alderney mob is grabbing all the headlines at the moment for one reason - the Commission wants them to be. They got put under the heat by people snitching and all this RICO bullshit. Now they're letting these guidos from over the West River get a name for themselves so the Feds'll start investigating them instead. Simple as that. There ain't no chance of these chumps getting any real power." Whatever the case may be, organized crime is here to stay in Liberty City.

;0x25B5A0DA=However, the recent wave of state investigations into organized crime has weakened the hold of the Commission, opening up the way for a more ruthless, cutthroat approach to criminality. Gone are the days of the noble gangster leaving a tip in the pocket of truck drivers they knock over. Instead, the Alderney mob is leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake.

;0x2D99D38A=In a crazy week for stocks, prices went up, then came crashing down creating market instability and the chance for a lot of pundits to talk in a wide range of superlatives while pretending to understand what was going on. One pundit said, "It's carnage. It's like war out there. We've seen abstracts fall and futures hold steady. The bull is running, while the bear is taking it up the can." He declined to be named for this article.

;0x65F90E6C=In what many say will restore faith and pride in our country, the Jingoism Act was passed over objections of constitutional historians and rights groups. The Act requires anyone observing un-American behavior to contact authorities immediately. This includes witnessing or taking part in sexual activities not relegated to the missionary position, use of the F word, exposing a minor to adult conversation, exposure of the female breast (even for the purpose of breast feeding) and gives access to your medical records, tax records, library borrowing, if you shave downstairs, how many times you have taken the country's name in vain, and slurs against the president.

;0x7BEB4D40=With a series of robberies, allegations of extortion and several racketeering cases brought against them by the Alderney state government, the so-called Alderney mob is gaining more and more prominence and column inches. Allegedly run by businessman, Jimmy Pegorino, this crime family is a new phenomenon. Previously, Alderney rackets were held by the five Liberty City families: the Ancelottis, the Pavanos, the Gambettis, the Messinas, and the Lupisellas who together formed the Commission that for many years ran crime in this town.
