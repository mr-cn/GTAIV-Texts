;0xA1F008D8=The answer is, duct tape, plastic sheeting and raised city taxes. N.O.O.S.E officers give practical advice on racial profiling and identifying the symptoms of chemical and biological weapons; however, there is no surefire way to guarantee that you will be able to survive an offensive. Possible targets include: the Subway System, the Broker Bridge, Rotterdam Tower, Grand Easton Terminal and many others. A recent N.O.O.S.E press statement warns that, "We really can't be sure where an attack might occur. All we can say is that nowhere is safe." The threat level in Liberty City is Indigo 6.

;0xA236FE75=It's a long time since the city has had a proper serial killer and we think this is going to get worse before it gets better. Detective Squad Chief Jon Atkinson said, "I'm going to be getting my name in the papers a lot if this guy turns out to be a serial killer, so I've got to make sure I don't say or do anything stupid. We strongly recommend people don't go out and, if they do, that they stay where there's lots of people and carry a cell phone or a policeman with them at all times. The most important thing, though, is that people don't panic more than is strictly necessary." We will keep you posted.

;0xA7148830=It's the reality nobody wants to face up to. It's the stuff of nightmares - police have admitted they are concerned about similarities in a series of murder cases over the past few years, making them think a serial killer may be at work in Liberty City. The killer, who's yet to be given a nickname, seems to have a particular thing against keep-fit enthusiasts as the three victims so far were joggers. Each had been decapitated after running late at night. It seems we are in for a news bonanza as we consider the ramifications of this terrifying case in gruesome detail and try to figure out exactly who will star in the movie. In the meantime, police strongly recommend people pay more taxes and push for a rise in both overtime benefits and basic pay.

;0xB1362764=A recent survey of known terrorists has revealed that Liberty City is the most desirable target for an attack. Some cite its visibility in films and TV shows such as the Weazel Network's '72'. Others mention the banks trading on Liberty City's BAWSAQ 100 stock exchange. Others just don't like the Liberty City "attitude". Whatever the reason, Liberty City has never been in more danger of being hit by a terrorist attack than it is today. The National Office of Security Enforcement gives a statistical probability of 90% for an attack being attempted in the next 5 years. What can a resident of Liberty City do to prevent such an attack?
