;0x54F9D6B8=Police officers spoke out yesterday about the incredible spate of urban myths that are damaging the image of Liberty City. The nonstop rumors of dead pop stars, sasquatches, giant alligators, secret cities, invincible criminals, and dogs have all been causing wide spread disturbances "in the minds of insane residents", said one spokesman, who was investigating reports a man had his drink spiked and a kidney stolen, which turned out to be spurious. We will stay with this story. In related news, police are investigating claims a whale was seen swimming in Middle Park.

;0x868CF4CF=An audacious prison escape, like something you might see on a Weazel Network show, occurred ninety seven feet under the surface of the West River earlier. A convoy carrying convicted felon, Aiden O'Malley, was ambushed by two trucks. O'Malley was being taken from a police station in Algonquin back to the Alderney State Correctional Facility. Two men used the trucks to block the convoy from the front and the back in the middle of the Booth Tunnel while they freed O'Malley. O'Malley, 48, who is American born but spent much of his adult life in Ireland, was serving a twenty-year term for his involvement in a string of robberies.

;0xAE86C4C2=O'Malley was returning from a deposition in which he gave evidence implicating his accomplices in the carrying-out of those robberies. Police were particularly interested in his testimony relating to Bucky Sligo, who recently died. Now authorities are concerned that all of his testimony may have been used somehow to facilitate his escape. Police warn that O'Malley and his cohorts are armed and considered very dangerous.
