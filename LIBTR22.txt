;0x104538F5=Jayvon Simson's body was one of the many collected by coroners in Algonquin recently. It wasn't a knife or a gun or a rocket launcher that killed this man though... he was killed by video games. Witnesses report a heated argument outside Videogeddon arcade, an establishment where addicts pump quarters into computers to get their fix of horrific violence. The argument was followed by a chase on motorbikes then his grizzly murder. It is no surprise that upset community leaders are pointing to games as the cause of this death; the pattern of altercation, vehicle chase, murder, rebirth and try again is common in video games. Although Mr. Simson was a known drug user and dealer with several convictions, we are certain this case is due to polygons and pixels not parole boards.

;0x8EE19541=Some of us never have successful resolution of the Oedipus Complex, a situation that turned deadly in Rotterdam Hill. Joshua Hampton, age 6 months, was arrested by police after a neighbor called in a report of strange noises at the apartment next door. Police found the body of Abraham Hampton, 31, stuffed under a baby changing station in their Rotterdam Hill apartment and, just like Laius and Jocasta, Joshua and his mother were already planning their wedding.

;0xA7E0AEF8=The renovation of the Libertonian continues. Not content with having donated a wing, Lyle Cleethorpes, of the famous labor-trading and sweatshop-owning family, has donated workers on his payroll to assist the renovation process. Cleethorpes said, "Any end to speed this process is worth it. I remember walking through this museum as a child and thinking what a great testament to mankind it would be if my name were on every wing of the place. I donated all of my "helpers" because it's such a shame that no one can see the splendor of our wing and marvel at what our family has achieved." This city only survives because of the generosity of philanthropists like Lyle Cleethorpes.
