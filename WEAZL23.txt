;0x244D53F0=The city is in the throes of chaos as the National Office of Security Enforcement increased the terror threat level in Liberty City to a new height. N.O.O.S.E has created the Charcoal 8 Level in order to bridge the gap between the Red High 7 risk level and Black Severe 9. At Charcoal 8, citizens should be wary of the new forms of attack becoming open to the twenty-first-century terrorist in addition to all of the other means in his arsenal.

;0x35FCF74F=In particular, N.O.O.S.E warns us to be aware of a terrorist-led assault upon American morale and patriotism including possible media-terrorism and cyber-terrorism. America decides what's right and wrong. Articulating anti-American thoughts is a form of terrorism and should be treated as such.

;0x60000B11=How can we expect to compete in the global marketplace if our unions are run by thugs brandishing weapons and making unreasonable demands for minimum wage and health care? The only way to be sure that business is conducted fairly in this city is for the unions to be dissolved and the labor market totally deregulated.

;0x6AD720BF=Not content with killing off the entrepreneurial spirit, some unions have taken to violence. The recent bloodbath on Yusuf Amir's construction site in Castle Gardens can only be attributed to one thing - the endemic corruption in construction unions in the Liberty City area. The so-called victims of this massacre were carrying semi-automatic weapons! This writer doesn't want to disrespect the dead, but I suspect the only time that these mob associates handled concrete was when they coated a victim's feet in it and dropped him into the Humboldt River. These mobsters were attempting to defraud a foreign business man and they were a disgrace to this great country.
