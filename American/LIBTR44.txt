;0xD047AF34=The music was powerful, the conversations were earnest and the sex was mind-blowing. It seemed like the party was never going to end. Then it did. You got a bit fat around the middle. You began having serious conversations about mortgages. Ravers and party goers emerged from the best decade of their lives only to be hit with the grim reality that they were going to pay the price for all that fun. Ten years later, people are starting to worry when all the devastating long-term effects are going to kick in. The answer is any minute. "Every time I get a cold or forget my keys, I am convinced that it's the beginning of the end; that I'm going to be found rocking in darkened room in a state of permanent catatonia from all that LSD, Ecstasy and weed I did," said James, a 33-year-old lawyer from Algonquin, "If it doesn't happen soon, I'm going to dust off the white gloves and glow sticks and get back out there."

The couple refused to comment upon the tragedy, but witnesses report seeing a car pull up next to the wedding party and firing shots from the window. Police are looking for the culprit. Mr. Bellic's cousin was reported to have left the scene soon after the murder. He is being sought for questioning in the case but not as a suspect.

;0xFC819B60=The tragic death of Charles Pathmanson became even more tragic as investigators say a tragic tale of tragedy is unfolding in the tragic emails sent to Pathmanson days before his tragic tragedy. Known to have built the "Kitchen of the Future", Pathmanson had been battling hackers who had broken into his appliances and began turning them on and off, setting his oven at 500 degrees in the middle of the night, fatally breaking the ice machine, and continually making the toaster pop up and down. In an act of desperation, Pathmanson attempted to install a firewall and new motherboard in the toaster, at which point hackers switched it on and electrocuted him. Police are trolling online games and "asking these snotfaced little egomaniacal griefers if they know anything about it," Police investigator Mike Loretti said in a statement.
