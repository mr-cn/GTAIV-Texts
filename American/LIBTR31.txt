;0x52D3C532=A man in period dress was found literally headless after a brawl outside a Dukes movie theater that was showing the movie Dragonbrain. Fans of the movie franchise often dress as their favorite character from the movie and speak in Middle English. Police say the fans argue over movie minutia within the smallest point of trivia sometimes leading to violent conflict. The assailant in the altercation is still being sought by police, but witnesses say he was dressed in a jester costume and playing a lute when he got involved in an argument with the victim about whether it was a realistic plot point that a dragon could breed with a horse. The argument turned violent with the jester seizing the victim's sword and fatally wounding him. Police are requesting any court jesters in the area to come forward voluntarily so that they can eliminate them from their inquiries.

"This is absolutely unacceptable," said a statement from the team's owners, "The Swingers are here to play baseball and win games. Coaches are expected to push players to the limit, both physically and pharmacologically." Most fans agree after the several seasons of poor performance by the Swingers organization.
