;0xC5DD6F4B=Today, the LCPD is hungry for blood. They're out to find a killer who took one of their own, Deputy Police Commissioner Francis McReary. McReary was gunned down in a small courtyard park in Algonquin. He was apparently killed with a high-caliber rifle shot from some distance. McReary's recent career has been mired in controversy. Some news outlets claim they have evidence of bribe-taking and corruption by Mr. McReary, claims he strongly denied until his death. In an unrelated incident his brother, Gerald McReary, a convicted felon, was recently arrested again on racketeering charges.

;0xCF2CD2B7=Today the Liberty Tree witnessed an emotional reunion between an Algonquin couple and their son who was lost for six years in a KRAPEA store. A well-known pedophile at Krapea's Alderney branch alerted staff to a pallid youth whom he had spotted sleeping in the same bunk-bed on his last three visits. The child's mother told reporters, "It's a miracle. We were sure that our son was dead and had even converted his bedroom into a home gym. He appears to be a little institutionalized and cannot understand why we don't have fifteen adjacent kitchens but it's great to have him back."
