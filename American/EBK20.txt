;0x01FEE9FB=That's MY own reality, bro. Tantric as fuck!!! Ask any doorman in Liberty City - I'm A-gaming it 24/7. My name's laminated onto the guest list at Maisonette 9 for fuck sake! I'm the kind of guy who can cage fight in the morning and get a pedicure in the afternoon. I'm metromacho, baby!!! 100% VIP with 0% BMI. But they won't put a perfect body in the media these days because it sends out the 'wrong message' to emo teenagers. It's fucked up, man. The world's gone crazy. Dial it in. Chisel it out. Genetically different.

I cannot wait for you to get down the gym and get some proper guns and get yourself a bloody tan. Man, you're a winner, but you do NOT look the part, amigo. Anyway, that racing was pretty intense, and I felt proud to roll with you. We're something else, man.

;0xA69BB336=I'm starting to totally FLIP MY SHIT with <a href="www.our-own-reality.com">www.our-own-reality.com</a>. I put sex tapes on the internet every day and they're running stories on Tyrone 'The Tower' Hancock??? Some old drunk who once had his name on a pair of sneakers in the 1980s. Big fucking deal. Last week I boned an air hostess, a lap dancer and a chick who once played a burn victim on Medicate Me.

;0xCFBD8579=You seen this ZiT! shit yet? You dial 948 555 0100 on your phone and it tells you whatever track is playing in the background. I guess there's a room full of geeks in some warehouse listening to all the songs or something. Who gives a shit how it's done, it's awesome for impressing the bitches in the clubs with your music knowledge. Not that my cut abs, bulging pecs and monster sized bar tabs don't impress them enough. You get me!?!?!?! ALPHA! Thought a player like you would appreciate this stuff.

I'm rolling at the top of my game and they're writing shit about Mr 2.0 Tony McFucking Tony! More like Mr 2ft tall Tiny McTiny. Teenage girls aren't interested in a midget with abs like cottage cheese. I'd like to see him try to benchpress 400lb with his pelvis. Nobody's more VIP than me - I've fucked more models than bulimia, baby! The paparazzi are losing their edge. We need to get out to the clubs and put some bitches to the sword! LET'S OWN IT!!!!
