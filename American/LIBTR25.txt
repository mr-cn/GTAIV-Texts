We shouldn't be asking who they were working for, why they had weapons or why they were on the docks in the first place. We should be asking who killed these young men." Authorities are searching for two suspects, both white males.

;0xB16F1DF5=This time it was a young dance instructor from Broker who had his head removed, but police are struggling to see a pattern or get any traction on the case. Detective Jon Atkinson, who is covering the case, said, "To be honest, it's down to underfunding - unless the police force are given better overtime and better pensions, there is no way this guy can be caught. But I want everyone to know, I will be writing a book about this case, and anyone trying to beat me to market will be sued if they mention my name. It's a tragedy." When asked about how he would respond to the on-going naming crisis that bedevils this case, he said, "It's awful. These people have died in vain and my marketing campaign is in tatters."

;0xEAD5883D=The bodies of several men have been found at the docks in Fishmarket South. Authorities believe they may have been members of a "triad" street gang smuggling contraband into Liberty City. Last year's prosecution of several members of the Dockworker's Union led to allegations of widespread corruption amongst the stevedores. A spokesperson for the National Office of Security Enforcement stated that the docks in Liberty City are the gateway through which the majority of drugs, sex slaves and counterfeit goods come into the United States, "It is only a matter of time before a terrorist smuggles a nuclear weapon through our docks. If the unions do not clean their act up and agree to serious salary cuts and concessions, this is a very real danger."
