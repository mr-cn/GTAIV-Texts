;0x2E3AE0DD=The police are demanding greater funds and expect massive public anxiety over the matter. One criminal expert, Jimmy Cast, is less convinced. The well-known expert on organized crime in our city commented, "There will always be gangs of criminals at work, especially when you have a lot of poor immigrants, but the idea that they will ever supersede the Mafia in importance is frankly laughable, as they will never be able to take control of so many government and city departments. Of course, following years of being attacked by law enforcement, the Mafia are in decline, but bear in mind it also serves them to exaggerate the extent of their decline so people leave them alone." Whichever way you look at it, crime in Liberty City remains an international business and something we do best.

;0xA5186AF6=The Swingers have announced to baseball officials that they will officially strike if the city refuses to come to the bargaining table regarding the building of a new stadium. Designs call for a radical vision of all luxury boxes and no open seats. "Sponsorships and corporate boxes are the most important thing in baseball, and currently we aren't able to serve our real fans. And by real fans I mean the ones who are able to support the team with $50,000 luxury boxes. It makes a player feel good to know that fans are comfortable in air-conditioned luxury boxes, knocking back 12 or 18 beers, shoving nachos in their faces and making passes at each other's wives," said team manager Henry Thornsteen.

;0xB2C8E9FB=Once it was the Mafia, the Jewish mob and the fighting Irish. Now it is Albanian, Russian, Jamaican and Korean hoodlums who are as likely to be running rackets and dealing drugs. Crime in Liberty has changed as the population has changed, and the recent bloodbath in a Hove Beach nightclub has shone a light on the murky world of the underworld. The police have few links with these newer communities in our city, and language barriers often make it harder for them to find out what is going on, so crime has run riot in a way not seen since the passing of the RICO act in the 1970s.

;0xE8CEC144=A nightclub owner is dead and the beachside communities of east Broker are in panic after another violent shoot out last night. Patrons at the Russian-themed Perestroika night club and cabaret were horrified when an argument between the owner and a man he appeared to know ended in murder. The owner, Mikhail Faustin, 45, was killed along with several accomplices whose names have not yet been released by police. The assailant escaped. Eye witnesses described a dark-haired European man in his late twenties or early 30s of average height and build, which does not narrow it down that much.
