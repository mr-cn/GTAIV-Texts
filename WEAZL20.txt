;0xC65F84D3=Worrying trends on the markets as the BAWSAQ refused to allow a discernible pattern to emerge. It went up and it went down and then it went nowhere. And we are not sure what to make of it; in a world in which no news is definitely bad news, especially for our ability to make money off this website. The fact is we'd like a pattern, as that would give us a story and currently we've got neither. It's a mess, and that makes it harder for people to say anything intelligent. Like when you vomit. It's not a bull, it's not a bear. It's a puddle of bile.

So come on Feds, loosen up regulations, stop trying to tell us what to do and allow unbridled capitalism to let the power brokers gain greater control for all our good.
